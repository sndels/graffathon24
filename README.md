# skunkwork
![screenshot](screenshot.png)

A lightweight framework for fooling around with GLSL-shaders, mainly designed for demos. Current features:
  * Includes in glsl
    * nesting supported
    * error lines parsed into vscode links per file on some drivers
      * filepath and raw error line otherwise
  * Dynamic uniform edit UI
    * `d*` Hungarian notation uniforms are picked up
    * `float`, `vec2` and `vec3` currently supported
  * Auto-reloading shaders when sources change
  * Gpu-"profiler"
    * Timing instances can't be interleaved because GL_TIMESTAMP doesn't work on OSX
  * Music playback and sync using SDL_mixer
  * Rocket-interface
    * `float` uniforms using `r*` Hungarian notation are picked up dynamically
  * Mercury's [hg_sdf](http://mercury.sexy/hg_sdf) included for CSG
  * Basic built-in shaders
     * noise, prng
     * physically based BRDF for shading
     * SDF font rendering

I have used [emoon's](https://github.com/emoon/rocket) as my Rocket-server.

## Build targets
There are two builds: `skunkwork` holds all the bells and whistles while `skunktoy` drops Rocket and audio integration for more minimalist shader tinkering.

## Dependencies
Building requires SDL dependencies and on linux `libasound2-dev`. [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.git), [SDL_mixer](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer), [dear imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), [Rocket](https://github.com/rocket/rocket) and [gl3w](https://github.com/sndels/libgl3w) are submodules with their respective licenses.

## Building
The CMake-build should workâ„¢ on Linux (Ninja) and Windows 10 (Visual Studio 2022).
